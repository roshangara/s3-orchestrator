// Ops - Bulk Rewrite Driver
//
// Author: Alex Freidah
//
// The pagination, download, transform, re-upload and metadata-update loop every
// fleet-wide rewrite pass runs. Encryption and compression are co-equal
// consumers: each supplies a listing query, a transform and the labels its run
// reports under, and neither owns the loop.
//
// A pass reads and rewrites an entire fleet, so it is the largest consumer of
// egress in the system. Everything here that looks defensive - per-object usage
// admission, cursor paging, the cap counting rewrites rather than rows - is
// there because a pass that gets one of them wrong either exhausts a metered
// backend or silently skips half the fleet while reporting success.
