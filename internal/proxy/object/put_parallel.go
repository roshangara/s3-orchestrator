// Object Manager - PUT Fan-Out
//
// Author: Alex Freidah
//
// Places an object's copies during the write instead of leaving every one after
// the first to the replicator, which would read the object back off a backend
// and pay that backend's egress to make each of them. The payload is already in
// hand and replayable, so a further copy costs one more upload and no read.
//
// Off unless an operator turns it on: the work is lower but it lands at write
// time rather than spread across replicator cycles. PutObject owns the
// sequential path this replaces, in put.go.
