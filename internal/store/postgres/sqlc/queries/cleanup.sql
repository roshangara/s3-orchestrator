-- sqlc-input definitions for cleanup_queue and cleanup_dlq operations.
-- Covers the enqueue + retry-state lifecycle, the move-to-DLQ flow that
-- graduates exhausted rows, and the engine-side helpers core/ uses for the
-- atomic stale-row sweep that keeps orphan_bytes in lockstep with row
-- delete.

-- name: EnqueueCleanup :exec
-- storage_key is what the worker deletes; object_key rides along so an operator
-- reading the queue still sees which object the orphan belongs to. They differ
-- for every row written since per-write storage keys, and a row queued before
-- them holds the same value in both.
INSERT INTO cleanup_queue (backend_name, object_key, storage_key, reason, size_bytes)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5);

-- name: GetPendingCleanups :many
-- Read-only listing for the admin endpoint and operator visibility. The
-- worker uses ClaimPendingCleanups instead, which also stamps the row.
-- claimed_at and claimed_by are projected so the admin view can render
-- which rows are currently held by a worker.
SELECT id, backend_name, object_key, storage_key, reason, attempts, size_bytes,
       claimed_at, claimed_by
FROM cleanup_queue
WHERE next_retry <= NOW() AND attempts < 10
ORDER BY created_at ASC
LIMIT $1;

-- name: ClaimPendingCleanups :many
-- Atomically claims the next batch of cleanup rows for the calling
-- instance. The inner SELECT uses FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED so two
-- concurrent claim transactions across instances return disjoint row
-- sets. A row is eligible if it has never been claimed (claimed_at IS
-- NULL) or its claim has aged past the grace cutoff (claimed_at <
-- @grace_cutoff). The reclaimed projection lets the worker increment
-- s3o_cleanup_queue_stale_claims_recovered_total per recovered row.

-- name: DeleteCleanupItem :exec
-- Used inside the move-to-DLQ transaction; orphan_bytes is intentionally
-- left untouched because the underlying backend object is still on disk.
-- The cleanup worker's success path uses CompleteCleanupItem instead,
-- which atomically deletes the row and decrements orphan_bytes.
DELETE FROM cleanup_queue WHERE id = $1;

-- name: CompleteCleanupItem :exec
-- Atomically removes a successfully-processed cleanup_queue row and
-- decrements the backing backend's orphan_bytes by the row's size.
-- Idempotent against re-claim retries: if the row was already deleted
-- by a previous worker, the CTE is empty and orphan_bytes is not
-- double-decremented. GREATEST(0, ...) clamps the counter so a stale
-- size_bytes value cannot drive orphan_bytes negative.

-- name: UpdateCleanupRetry :exec
-- Schedules a retry by advancing next_retry, recording the error, and
-- clearing the claim so the row is immediately re-eligible for the next
-- worker tick (the previous claim is what gated this retry from running
-- twice within the grace window).

-- name: SumCleanupQueueSizeByKey :one
-- Returns the sum of size_bytes for every cleanup_queue row matching the
-- given (storage_key, backend_name) pair. Used by the reconciler-driven
-- sweep so orphan_bytes can be decremented in step with the row delete.
--
-- Matched on the path rather than the object, because the row being swept is a
-- queued deletion of particular bytes and the reconcile that triggers it has
-- established that those bytes are gone. Sweeping by object would also drop the
-- queued deletions of the key's other writes, whose bytes are still there.

-- name: HasPendingCleanup :one
-- Reports whether a delete for (object_key, backend_name) is still
-- outstanding: either waiting in the retry queue or dead-lettered after
-- exhausting its attempts. Both mean the bytes are still on the backend and
-- the object is meant to be gone, which is what stops reconcile importing it
-- back. Dead-lettered counts because retrying stopped, not because the delete
-- was withdrawn.

-- Inserts an exhausted cleanup_queue row into the dead-letter table.

-- remembers how long the cleanup was outstanding.

-- statement; cleanup_queue defaults reset created_at/next_retry to NOW()
-- and attempts to 0. orphan_bytes is untouched here - it was never

-- retried delete finally succeeds. An empty backend requeues every
