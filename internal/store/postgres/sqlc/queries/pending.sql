-- sqlc-input definitions for pending_objects - the in-flight PUT intent
-- table that backs the PUT-before-COMMIT write-path pattern. Covers
-- inserting an intent, atomically claiming and resolving it, and the
-- timestamp-aware reaper scan that finds stale rows surviving a failed
-- metadata commit.
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- name: InsertPendingObjectIfFits :execrows
-- Claims the bytes and records the intent in one statement, so admission and
-- the durable record of it cannot disagree.
--
-- The headroom is read inside this statement rather than from a snapshot, which
-- is what makes the limit hold across a fleet: every instance's committed
-- bytes, orphans, and writes in progress are rows here, so two instances
-- admitting at once are judged against the same totals. Zero rows affected
-- means the backend had no room and the caller should try the next candidate.
--
-- bytes_limit = 0 is unlimited, matching every other reader of the column.
INSERT INTO pending_objects (
    intent_id, object_key, storage_key, backend_name, size_bytes,
    encrypted, encryption_key, key_id, plaintext_size, content_hash,
    compression_algorithm, compression_level, compression_format_version, logical_size,
    etag, content_type, user_metadata, role
)
-- backend_name and size_bytes are cast explicitly because they appear both
-- here and in the headroom test below. A bare parameter in a SELECT list takes
-- no type from the INSERT target the way one in VALUES does, so Postgres would
-- otherwise deduce them from the arithmetic in the WHERE, come out with
-- integer, and reject the statement for contradicting the bigint column.

-- name: ClearPendingForKey :many
-- Removes the key's intents apart from the ones the caller is committing, and
-- reports what it removed so the caller can clean their bytes off the backends
-- once its own transaction is durable.
--
-- Unconditional even for a backend the caller is writing to: the row left
-- behind would let an upload still in flight commit a copy of the object this
-- write just replaced. Whether those bytes are deleted is the caller's decision,
-- and a different one.

-- pending_objects model rather than minting a query-specific struct; storage_key
-- is last because that is where the migration added it.
