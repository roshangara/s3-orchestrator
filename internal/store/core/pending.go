// Core Pending Object Orchestration

// Author: Alex Freidah
//
// Engine-agnostic transactional logic for the pending_objects table. The write
// path inserts an intent before the backend PUT and removes it on a successful
// metadata commit. Intents that survive a failed commit are resolved by the
// reaper via PromotePending. The orchestration honours the conservative
// supersession contract: a newer object_locations row for the same key
// supersedes the intent and the reaper drops it without writing metadata.

// nothing here knows whether the bytes at that path are whole; there is a copy
// we can vouch for - the client was told the write succeeded, which only
// happens once a copy commits - so rebuilding from that copy is cheaper than
// being wrong. The replication worker sees the shortfall and fills it on its
// next pass.
//
// The one case that leaves the backend alone is a recorded copy at this
// intent's own path, which means a commit got there first and the bytes belong
// to it. A copy recorded on the same backend at a different path is a different
// write's, and deleting this intent's bytes does not touch it - which it used
// to, when every write of a key shared one path.

// discardUntrustedCopy resolves an upload whose write has been overtaken: the

// It removes those bytes and nothing else. They sit at this write's own path,
// which no other write shares, so whatever the key holds on this backend now -
// a copy the newer write committed, a copy from a third write, nothing at all -
// is untouched by deleting them, and the row describing it stays.
//
// That is the fix for issue #1527. This used to delete the backend object at
// the key and the row naming a copy there, because every write of a key stored
// its bytes at that one path and there was no way to tell whose they were. When
// the losing upload resolved before the winner committed, the deletion was
// queued against a path the winner then wrote, and it took the winner's bytes
// out from under a freshly committed row: the ledger claimed a copy that did
// not exist, replication_pending read zero, and only a scrub cycle - minutes
// later, or longer - could notice.
//
// Nothing is charged against the counter here. These bytes were never recorded,
// so the backend's total never included them, and the intent that was holding
// them against its headroom is already gone.
