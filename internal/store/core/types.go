// OBJECT METADATA
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ObjectIdentity is what the client sees an object as, independent of which
// copy answers: the validator conditional requests compare against, the
// content type it was written with, and the user metadata it carries. The
// counterpart to StoredForm, which describes the bytes on the backend instead.
//
// ETag is the MD5 of the bytes the client wrote, or the AWS composite for a
// multipart upload, and is therefore not what the backend reports once the
// stored bytes are compressed or encrypted.
//
// A nil *ObjectIdentity means unknown - a row written before identity was
// recorded, or an object imported from a backend - and a read falls back to
// asking the backend. That is distinct from a present identity with an empty
// ContentType or an empty UserMetadata, which are answers in themselves.
type ObjectIdentity struct {
	ETag         string

// missing the ETag cannot: the response has to carry a validator, and the only
// place left to get one is the backend.

	return i != nil && i.ETag != ""
}

// StoredForm describes how the bytes on a backend differ from the logical
// object a client sees: whether they are compressed, whether they are an
// encryption envelope, the key needed to read them back, and the sizes and
// hash they reduce to. The write path produces one per stored copy and the
// store records it; the read path needs it to serve the object correctly.
//
// An empty CompressionAlgorithm means the bytes are not compressed, so there
// is no separate flag that could drift out of step with it. LogicalSize is the
// size of the object the client wrote and differs from PlaintextSize once both
// features are on: the stored bytes are then ciphertext of compressed data, so
// PlaintextSize is the pre-encryption (compressed) size while LogicalSize is
// the original. CompressionLevel does not affect decoding and is carried for
// diagnostics and for rewrite passes.
//
// The zero value describes bytes stored verbatim, which is also why Unmanaged
// is negated: it is stored as the `managed` column, so a construction site that
// omits the field cannot accidentally produce a row every worker ignores.

// along with the size and any encryption or integrity metadata.
//
// LastScrubbedAt is nil for a copy that has never been verified, which is a
// different state from one verified long ago and has to stay distinguishable.
// It is also nil on rows from queries that do not select the column, so a
// caller reading it wants a query that does.
//
// Unmanaged marks an object that exists on the backend but outside every
// configured virtual bucket prefix: real bytes the orchestrator did not write
// and does not act on. It is stored as the negated `managed` column, so the
// zero value means managed and a construction site that omits it cannot
// accidentally produce a row the workers ignore.
//
// StorageKey is the path this copy occupies on its backend, and it is what
// every path that reads, writes or deletes the bytes addresses them by. It is
// not the object's key: a write stores its bytes under the key plus its own
// intent id (see internalkey.StorageKey), so two writes of one key never share
// a path and a cleanup can only ever delete what it wrote. A row written before
// storage keys existed holds the object key, which is where its bytes are.
//
// The compression columns follow StoredForm: an empty algorithm means the
// bytes are stored verbatim, and they are zero on rows from queries that do
// not select them.
//
// CompressionProbeSize and CompressionProbeLevel are bookkeeping about the copy
// rather than a description of its content, like LastScrubbedAt: they record
// what the encoder measured for a copy it declined, so a later pass need not
// download it to measure again.
