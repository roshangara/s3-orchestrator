// Replica Verification - Hash-Check a New Copy Before Recording It
//
// Author: Alex Freidah
//
// Implements integrity.verify_on_replicate. A copy that has just been streamed
// to its target is read back, undone to plaintext, and compared against the
// source row's content_hash before the ledger row that makes it count toward
// the replication factor is written.
//
// Off by default. The read-back doubles the egress a replica costs, which is an
// operator's decision rather than a side effect of enabling hashing.

// is not a copy known to be bad, and discarding it would leave the object
// under-replicated to punish a backend for being slow or a hash for being
// absent. Backends that are not read-after-write consistent make that failure
